In product design, visualization is the process of creating images, models, or diagrams to represent ideas, concepts, or designs visually. 
It plays a crucial role in conveying complex ideas clearly and effectively, allowing team members, stakeholders, and users to understand the design intentions. 
Clear visualization ensures alignment and reduces misunderstandings, which is essential for efficient and successful product development.
